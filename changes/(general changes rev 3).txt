combo mode+ changelog overview:

when reading all character stat changes, the format is "old<new"
_______________________________________________________________________________
rev 3 general change info:

combo mode now officially has a custom wiimote screen to let you know right away you properly downloaded it.

we've got some new codes in place!

a fix for previous c stick issues. you no longer get tilts with smash stick. attack stick works a bit better but still needs more work to be fully functional.
back tilt now functions but hitting diagnol angles still makes you jab/nair.

a tech window fix to hopefully make teching a bit easier without making things like footstools and ganon side b techable.
this is very hard to test alone so you'll have to go by feel.

faster ledgegrab and release. no more laggy edges!

we got a code that exclusivley freezes Warioware and Delphino now as well, so the stage list is even better than ever!

otherwise, lots of new animations on characters in general. balance changes, bug fixes, more unique character abilities.

Currently unchanged characters:

peach: I have no clue how to play peach, i have never once played peach with any level of proficiency. Similarly, not even anyone i KNOW plays peach. because of this, i have literally no clue how to balance this character in a meaningful way.

Ice climbers: Same as peach.

Olimar: Every single pikmin olimar can use has different stats that all indiviually need balanced. i'm not doing that. nobody plays this stupid ass character. i'll worry about it later.

Wario: I totally could rework this character, but i don't want to right now. i hate this fat ugly farting piece of shit. i don't wanna give him awesome combos, he's fucking stupid.
