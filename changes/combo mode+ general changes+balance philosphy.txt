combo mode+ changelog overview:

when reading all character stat changes, the format is "old<new"
there's an image in the folder to help visualise this concept to those who struggle to understand.

rev 2 Universal changes:

grabs across the board have been buffed and made a standardized 6 frames.

as well, weight dependent throw speeds have been removed, throws will always remain the same speed.

finally, jump cancel grab is back, albeit a bit crazy on some characters (falcon/sonic).

stages are officially unfrozen, as i've ported in some P+ stuff and we now have a much more functional FD, Lylat, and Pokemon stadium. this means stages like smashville won't be jank anymore.
current downside, i haven't figured out a way to modify Warioware to have no transformations yet, and unfrozen stages means Delphino is no longer a viable stage pick.

MK and Diddy have been tweaked, you can read their changelogs in their text files.

Currently unchanged/unfinished characters:

peach: I have no clue how to play peach, i have never once played peach with any level of proficiency. Similarly, not even anyone i KNOW plays peach. because of this, i have literally no clue how to balance this character in a meaningful way.

Ice climbers: Same as peach.

Olimar: Every single pikmin olimar can use has different stats that all indiviually need balanced. i'm not doing that. nobody plays this stupid ass character. i'll worry about it later.

Zero Suit Samus: 2 things. first of all, all attacks using her plasma whip count as a projectile and not an attack?? this makes it annoying to find all of her attacks proper hitboxes. and second, ZSS is a very nearly unplayed character and i think i need to play her more before i change her further. she still has some changes.

Wario: I totally could rework this character, but i don't want to right now. i hate this fat ugly farting piece of shit. i don't wanna give him awesome combos, he's fucking stupid.

pikachu: Previously i forgot to mention i haven't changed pikachu, just haven't gotten to it and the character is very underplayed so i haven't touched him.
