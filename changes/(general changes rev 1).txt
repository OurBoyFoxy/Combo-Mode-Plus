combo mode+ changelog overview:
_______________________________________________________________________________
Universal changes (same as vanilla combo mode):

All characters jump heights are restored, universally increased by .2
(shorthops remain unchanged)

Semi-standardized jumpsquat, any character with a jumpsquat over 5 has been lowered to 5.

meteor canceling is removed.

all 3 pokemon trainer pokemon (ivy/squirtle/zard) have stamina and type weakness removed.

some characters have still had their up b's fixed even if it's not mentioned in their combo mode+ changes
_________________________________________________________________________________
Currently unchanged/unfinished characters:

peach: I have no clue how to play peach, i have never once played peach with any level of proficiency. Similarly, not even anyone i KNOW plays peach. because of this, i have literally no clue how to balance this character in a meaningful way.

Ice climbers: Same as peach.

Olimar: Every single pikmin olimar can use has different stats that all indiviually need balanced. i'm not doing that. nobody plays this stupid ass character. i'll worry about it later.

Zero Suit Samus: 2 things. first of all, all attacks using her plasma whip count as a projectile and not an attack?? this makes it annoying to find all of her attacks proper hitboxes. and second, ZSS is a very nearly unplayed character and i think i need to play her more before i change her further. she still has some changes.

Metaknight: Chester wants to balance MK. i was thinking of balancing him myself and then just letting chester overwrite whatever changes i made, but i decided to just leave MK alone to get the first build of combo mode+ out sooner.

Wario: I totally could rework this character, but i don't want to right now. i hate this fat ugly farting piece of shit. i don't wanna give him awesome combos, he's fucking stupid.

Diddy Kong: Having trouble fixing his up b. trying to work on it but don't wanna hold up everything while i figure this out then rework his kit.
_________________________________________________________________________________
Rewok/rebelance philosphy:
I did not try to perfectly balance combo mode+, i think doing that on my first attempt would be nearly impossible.
what i did try to do was give every character functional moves, reasonable frame data, and realistic kill confirms and followups.
some characters that had very linear gameplans i tried to rework to be more diverse.
this includes top/high tier characters. not everything is a buff, some things are meant to emphasize a new approach to gameplay.
some things might be OP, some things might suck, i'm not positive. this is the first run of combo mode+ so go easy on it.
and please, for the love of god, actually get into a match and play vs a real human opponent before you hop into training/against a bot and start saying something is overpowered or needs nerfed.
