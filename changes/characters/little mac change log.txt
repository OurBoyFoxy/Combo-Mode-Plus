Little mac joins combo mode!

i was excited to try my hand at balancing mac's gimmick of being strong on the ground and weak in the air. I attempted to design mac to be a technical character, needing to utilize cancels to make the most of his kit.

mac's primary gimmick is his dodge cancel - you can cancel his dodges into attacks, making for some very good evasive, fast, burst movement.

as a semi "bug" i'm trying to work out, his jab combo really only consistenly works if you hold "A" rather than tapping it.

he can double jump out of his side b, so be sure when recovering to side b first, then double jump, you'll get to use another side b/up b!
this also means you can end a combo in side b offstage and live if you still have double jump!

his f tilt has a unique mechanic. the first hit trips, and can be canceled into specials. this is important because counter (down b) can both cancel into attacks. this means you can confirm a lot of moves (including smash attacks) off of first hit side b cancels.
