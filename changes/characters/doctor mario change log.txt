doctor mario changes:
______________________________________________________________
rev 6 changes:

Doc is now a part of combo mode, and mostly what you expect.
he has a blend of melee doctor mario and ult doctor mario.

he has his ult stomp, killing up b, and the tornado back for down b.

he is slower than mario, both in the air and on the ground, but has much greater kill power and has high damage.

not many quirky gimmicks to him, he's about what you would expect.
the only major quirk worth mention is that he has the melee mario wall jump out of up b.
