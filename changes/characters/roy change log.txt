Roy changes:
_________________________________________________________________________________
rev 4 changes:

Roy is built off a combination of an old school "roy in brawl" mod and a "pm roy in brawl" mod. this was necessary for his files to function properly.

he has been adjusted to feel more natural in brawl's engine, and been slightly rebalanced and reworked from PM.

across the board he has less damage on his moves and a bit more endlag on some ground moves as compared to PM/P+.
